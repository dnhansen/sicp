# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Answers to exercises from *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* and the Berkeley course CS 61A.


### Configuration

*The following has only been tested on Windows 10.*

Racket and DrRacket can be downloaded [here](http://racket-lang.org/).

To properly configure DrRacket for *SICP* and the additional functionality used in CS 61A, install the packages `sicp` and `berkeley` in the package manager. Then start every file with the following lines:

    #lang sicp
    (#%require berkeley)


### Content

The book itself can be found at [the official site](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).

CS 61A no longer uses *SICP*, so the material used here is from the version given in spring 2011 ([course page](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/)). In particular, the following are used (direct links to `pdf` documents):

* [General course information](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/0.pdf)
* [Lecture notes](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/notes.pdf)
* [Laboratory problems](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/nodate-labs.pdf)
* [Homework problems](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/nodate-hw.pdf)

Projects and additional information can be found in the course readers ([volume 1](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol1.html), [volume 2](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol2.html)) and on the course page.

Furthermore, the lectures given in the spring 2010 version of the course can e.g. be found on YouTube.
